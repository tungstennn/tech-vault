## 1. K8s deployment (Junior)

```bash

Scenario:

A company wants to roll out a web service built on Kubernetes. To make this happen, complete a file stub located at /home/ubuntu/tech-vault-q1/special-definition.yml with the steps that do the following:

- Creates a new namespace named "CyberCo".
- Deploys a new "redis" image (sourced from Dockerhub) using the "buster" tag, under a deployment named "cache-db", within the "CyberCo" namespace.
- Scales the "cache-db" deployment to have 2 replicas.
- Opens port "6379" on the "cache-db" containers.

**Notes:**

- The finalized solution will be assessed in a fresh, isolated environment. Make sure all the configurations are stored in the /home/ubuntu/tech-vault directory.
- All tasks must be completed with a single `sudo execute` command, launched from the question directory. (Hint: use alias)
- You have sudo permissions if needed.

```

## 2. Linux Automation (Junior/Mid)

```bash

Scenario:

Complete the file stub located at `q2/runscript.sh` with one or more commands to achieve the following tasks:

- Extract the archive located at `/q2/backup.tar.gz`.
- Set permission "0664" for all the files that were just extracted.
- Set permission "0775" for all the directories that were just extracted.
- Change the owner to "anonymous" and the group to "no-team" for all the extracted files and directories.
- Create a new archive with the adjusted files and directories, naming it `/tmp/fixed-archive.tar.gz`.

**Notes:**

- Your solution will be evaluated in a new, clean setup. Make sure all work is performed in the `/q2` directory.
- Execute all tasks with a single `sudo activate` command run from within the question directory. (Hint: use alias)
- You have sudo permissions, if needed.

```

## 3. K8s enhancements (Junior/Mid)

```bash

Scenario:

While working on Kubernetes cluster enhancements, you need to set up a recurring task that makes a call to a remote API. Which of the following commands is correct to perform this action?

Pick ONE option:

1. `kubectl run cronjob task --image=toolbox --schedule="*/1 * * * *" -- curl -s https://api.cyber-widget.com/refresh`

2. `kubecmd create periodic-task --image=toolbox --timing="/1 * * * *" -- curl -s https://api.cyber-widget.com/refresh`

3. `kubecmd run periodic task --image=toolbox --timing="*/1 * * * *" -- curl -s https://api.cyber-widget.com/refresh`

4. `kubectl create cronjob task --image=toolbox --schedule="*/1 * * * *" -- curl -s https://api.cyber-widget.com/refresh`

**Notes:**

- The correct answer will be evaluated on its ability to perform the task as described.

```

## 4. SSL Certificates Junior

```bash

Scenario:

In the directory `/home/ubuntu/tech-vault-q4/taskrunner.sh`, you have an SSL certificate named `security.crt` and a private key named `secrecy.key`. Complete the `taskrunner.sh` file with steps to accomplish the following:

- **Task 1**: Create a new User entry in Kubeconfig named `operator` using the `security.crt` and `secrecy.key` located in `/home/ubuntu/tech-vault-q4/`.

- **Task 2**: Create a new Context entry named `operator` in Kubeconfig for the newly created User `operator`.

**Notes**

- The completed solution will be evaluated in a fresh environment. Make sure all your changes are in the `taskrunner.sh` file located in `/home/ubuntu/tech-vault-q4/`. Manual changes will not be preserved.

- Run `sudo execute` from the question directory to test the solution. (Hint: use alias)

- Sudo privileges are available, if needed.

```

## 5. Service roles in K8s

```bash

Scenario:

You are required to complete the definition file located at `/home/ubuntu/tech-vault-q5/cluster-role-def.yml`. The file should have configurations to perform the following actions:

- **Step 1**: Create a new Service Account named `chief-admin`.

- **Step 2**: Create a new Cluster Role named `monitor`, which gives permissions on all possible API groups, resources, and verbs.

- **Step 3**: Create a Cluster Role Binding named `chiefadmin-monitor` that binds the newly created Service Account `chief-admin` with the Cluster Role `monitor`.

### Notes

- The completed solution will be verified in a fresh, untouched environment. Ensure all your changes are confined to the `cluster-role-def.yml` file in `/home/ubuntu/tech-vault-q5`.

Welcome to SuperCoolTech, a leading tech company that specialises in cloud-native solutions. You are part of the DevOps team and are responsible for managing and maintaining the infrastructure. Everything at SuperCoolTech is deployed as code, and you use Terraform extensively for provisioning AWS resources.

Late one evening, you receive a notification that there are issues with a newly deployed Lambda function. The Lambda function is throwing errors, and there are issues with the S3 bucket where it's supposed to store data. You suspect there might also be some IAM role issues, but you're not sure yet.

**Your task** is to identify and resolve the issues as quickly as possible. You have a brief window late at night to fix this, as that is the least traffic period, and you need to ensure minimal disruption.

## Your Mission

Fork the existing project repo and clone it locally.
Navigate through the Terraform files, Lambda function code, and other project components to identify what's wrong.
Fix the broken parts and ensure that the Terraform configuration is idempotent and applies without errors.
Test to confirm that the Lambda function is now working as expected and the S3 bucket is correctly configured.
Document the changes you've made and what each change accomplishes.

## Constraints

You cannot change the Terraform provider settings.
You are limited to the current AWS services and can't introduce a new service for this task.
All changes should be implemented via code (Infrastructure as Code).

## Success Criteria

Terraform code applies without any errors.
Lambda function executes successfully and performs its task.
S3 bucket correctly configured and accessible by the Lambda function.

```

<details>
<summary>Q17 Answers - ONLY LOOK once done (or for interviewers)</summary>

1. main.tf: s3_key for aws_lambda_function is wrong, as the zip file doesn't exist.

2. handler.py: Missing an import for json.

3. README.md: No mention of deploying the Lambda function code to the S3 bucket.

4. main.tf: IAM role permissions not sufficient for Lambda to write logs.

You're the new DevOps Engineer at XYZ Corp. The team has been having issues keeping track of system metrics for their Linux-based application servers. Your task is to write a script that will be run periodically to collect some system metrics and output them to a log file.

**Your Task**

Your Bash script should do the following:

- Capture the current CPU usage.
- Capture the current Memory usage.
- Capture the Disk usage for the / partition.
- Output all these metrics with timestamps to a log file located at /var/log/sys_metrics.log.

**Script Requirements**

- The script must be executable.
- All output must be appended to the log file; do not overwrite the previous logs.

Example Log File Output:

#######################################################

[Timestamp] CPU: x%, Memory: x%, Disk: x%
[Timestamp] CPU: x%, Memory: x%, Disk: x%

#######################################################

**Evaluation Criteria**

Accurate capture of system metrics.
Successful logging of metrics to the log file.
Proper error handling and script execution permissions.

**Hints**
You can use commands like top, free, df and utilities like awk to capture the system metrics.

Please note, the users must have sudo permissions to write to /var/log/sys_metrics.log or another approach would be to execute the script as a superuser.

4. **Monitoring**: Make sure to include monitoring checks to verify configurations.

5. **Documentation**: Provide a README file with setup instructions, how to run your Puppet configurations, and how to execute tests.

## Bonus
- **Scalability**: Show how your solution can scale to handle more servers.
- **Security**: Implement some basic security practices like firewall rules or file integrity checks.

## Tips
- Make sure to document your steps well.
- Try to automate as much as possible.

## Deliverables
- All Puppet manifests.
- Testing scripts.
- A README.md with instructions.
